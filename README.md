# PublicWeb
A public-facing marketing site for SocialCompany Inc

![Build Status by TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/SocialCompanyInc/PublicWeb.svg?branch=master)

## Frameworks
I started this using Skeleton CSS framework and nothing else.

## Deployment
Part of my goal with this is to learn how to work with TravisCI, Amazon S3 and GitHub. Eventually I'd like to see this website editable by anyone with repo access.
